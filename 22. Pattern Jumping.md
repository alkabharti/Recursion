Pattern Jumping :

A frog starts at the point 0. In his first turn, he can make a jump of 1 unit. Now for all consequent turns, if the frog is currently at a distance x (from the start), his jump will take him x units forward. Given a leaf at a distance N, you have to find if the frog can reach that leaf or not.
