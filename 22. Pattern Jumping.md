## Pattern Jumping :

A frog starts at the point 0. In his first turn, he can make a jump of 1 unit. Now for all consequent turns, if the frog is currently at a distance x (from the start), his jump will take him x units forward. Given a leaf at a distance N, you have to find if the frog can reach that leaf or not.

### Solution :

Time Complexity :


```java
class Solution 
{
    static String canJump(Long N) 
    {
        if(N==1)
            return "True";
        else if(N%2!=0)
            return "False";
        return canJump(N/2);
    }
};

```
